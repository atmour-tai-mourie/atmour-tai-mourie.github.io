                    <h5>The problem that blocked me</h5>
                    <p>
                        I encountered a problem and got stuck on the capitalise function of the built-in methods kata.
                        Completing this kata required creating a function that capitalises the first letter of each word
                        in a sentence. My solution was to create an array with an item for each world, then loop through
                        the array capitalising the first letter of each word, finally putting the words back together as
                        a sentence (string).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The problem I encountered was that my initial approach involved taking the first letter of each
                        word using the index of the word then index of the first letter ( wordArray[i][0]). The
                        wordArray[i] part returns the word, then the final [0] returns the first letter of the word. I
                        tried to capitalise this letter and set the first letter to it using <code>wordArray[i][0] =
                        wordArray[i][0].toUpperCase</code>. However my result was not passing the tests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I used console.log to see what I was returning from the function, and I could see that I was
                        returning the sentence without any capitalisations. I then logged each word in the array as I
                        looped through them, after I had made my changes. No capitalization, so I could assume that my
                        code to capitalise the first letter of the word was not working. I was frustrated not
                        understanding why my logic was not capitalising the first letter. I ended up googling how to
                        capitalise each word in an array, and was given stackoverflow question that showed the following
                        answer:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <code> for (i = 0; i < wordArray.length; i++) { <br>
                            wordArray[i] = wordArray[i].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + wordArray[i].slice(1)<br>
                          }
                        </code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This worked! Now I had to figure out why this worked and my solution did not. The first thing I
                        checked was using the .charAt(0) method, trying to reassign the first letter of the word to a
                        capital version of itself. No luck. I had also noticed that the item itself was being
                        reassigned, rather than just the first letter. After some more googling in a moment of triumph I
                        learnt that array items are immutable. This means that they are not able to be altered, only
                        reassigned. Originally I was trying to tell JavaScript to change the first letter of the word to
                        uppercase, but JS was unable to change the word. So that was why the final solution got the
                        first letter, capitalised it and combined it back with the rest of the word, before then
                        reassigning the index of the original word to the capitalised version. Essentially replacing the
                        whole item rather than trying to change it.
                    </p>
                    <h5>My happy solution</h5>
                    <p>
                        I was very satisfied with how I solved the super fizzbuzz kata. The super fizzbuzz kata involved
                        replacing numbers in an array with fizz, buzz or fizzbuzz, if they were a multiple of 3, 5 or a
                        multiple of both 3 and 5 respectively. I originally thought I might be able to use a switch
                        method, but a quick google revealed the switch statement couldn’t take different conditions such
                        as identifying multiples of three, then 5 which I needed to do. So used a nested ternary
                        operator, which acted like if statements but looked much simpler and readable. To test if the
                        number was a multiple of 3, 5 or both, I used the remainder (%) operator, and checked for a
                        remainder when dividing for each number, if 0 was returned then it was a multiple. To simplify
                        this further I created a utility to return the remainder. If a number was a multiple fizz, buzz
                        or fizzbuzz was returned, if not then the number was returned. This solution looked very simple,
                        tidy and readable and I was very satisfied.
                    </p>

                        Finally to do this across the whole array, I simply created an empty new array, looped through
                        the array I was given, ran the fizzbuzz function over each value and pushed them into the new
                        array. Straightforward, easy and simple. Beautiful.
