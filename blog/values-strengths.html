            <h5>My Values</h5>
            <p>
              My values revolve around doing what is right for the community,
              learning continuously and enjoying life. I strongly believe in
              fairness, and that everybody should be treated equally. When
              learning I value knowledge along with the open-mindedness and
              curiosity I believe you need to learn. I believe in pragmatism and
              being challenged, finding a solution and executing no matter the
              circumstances. Finally, humour, love and adventure give me drive
              and happiness, and they are all essential for me and my life.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a situation I was in a couple of years ago that
              challenged my values and made me think about what mattered to me.
              I was working as a Forex CFD Broker, the company's core business
              was providing an opportunity for regular people to enter highly
              leveraged positions on financial products such as currencies, oil
              or cryptocurrencies. These products meant that our clients could
              either earn or lose incredible amounts of money in seconds. Many
              of our partners who referred clients (for a reward) tended to
              focus on the potential for riches, rather than the losses. Alas,
              most of the time they lost money, especially the people that
              couldn’t afford to lose. When they lost, because they had taken
              their position with us, we collected the money. It was essentially
              an online casino, under the guise of an investment.
            </p>
            <p>
              The longer I worked there, and as I moved over to the operational
              side of the business my naivety subsided and I began to realise
              how much our clients were losing and where it was going. That is
              where my values were seriously challenged. In my time at this
              company I was able to satisfy many of my core values, learning
              constantly, and I was so curious about how it all worked. I had to
              regularly come up with pragmatic solutions, and the furious pace
              and amount of money I was dealing with was exciting. Helping to
              manage millions of dollars of risk and creating infrastructure to
              facilitate the trading of multiples more keyed into my sense of
              adventure. Finally, I made some incredible friends there and the
              basis of these friendships were built around humour and love.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then just after the darling Covid had entered our lives, I had to
              perform some analysis. Covid had caused some major turbulence in
              financial markets, our clients were bleeding money and the
              Australian financial regulator was curious. I was tasked with
              analysing how much our clients had lost over this period. I can’t
              remember the exact amount but it was in the tens of millions of a
              week, then the next week a similar amount. I was truly confronted
              with what I was working to enable. Combined with the knowledge
              that many of our clients were either problem gamblers or sent to
              us with the promise of easy money, I realised that I needed to
              leave. I had known that I couldn’t stay there for too long, but
              this moment made me realise that I was enabling something that was
              truly unfair and predatory. I shook my own pride on my value of
              fairness and many other altruistic values that I had been brought
              up to have.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I resigned, not much longer after that incident. I began work
              at a training organisation helping others learn, but man did I
              miss the challenge, the excitement and working with my friends. It
              took me less than at that job to realise I was completely bored
              and unchallenged, and ready for the next adventure.
            </p>
            <h5>My Strengths & Limitations</h5>
            <p>
              Throughout my education and career, my strengths have allowed me
              to succeed in most of the roles I have been in. My resourcefulness
              and ability to problem solve have allowed me to find and implement
              solutions when given a goal or problem. I believe strongly in my
              ability to resolve conflict and bring everyone together for one
              solution, which I believe has saved my teams a significant amount
              of time in the discussion phase of projects or ideas as I easily
              can bring each person’s ideas and objectives together. My
              good-willed nature has made teamwork something that comes
              naturally and I have flourished in tight knit teams, but larger
              groups or organisations have tested my communication skills. I
              want to work more to become a self-starter, investigating and
              pursuing ideas with energy and conviction. I believe I could have
              achieved more in my work and education if I had focused on this
              earlier. Another key limitation for me has been organised
              reflection, as I do reflect frequently but the reflections are not
              recorded and structured in a way that is optimised for my personal
              development and longer term growth. Finally, a key thing that has
              helped me a little, but more often held me back is that I dive
              into problems head first without a thought. While the energy in
              these moments is powerful, I find myself wasting time making
              mistakes that could be avoided with planning and forethought.
            </p>
            <p>
              My astute ability to problem solve and resourcefulness have and
              will continue to be beneficial to my learning journey. Not only do
              they aid me in creating solutions for complex and challenging
              problems, but they are a key source of energy and flow for me.
              These strengths should give me the energy and confidence to
              persist through major obstacles. I can’t wait to begin more team
              and group oriented projects as I hope my strengths in this area
              will not only help my groups and I to successfully develop
              interesting ideas, but create a beneficial learning experience for
              everyone involved. Hopefully I will be able to help resolve any
              creative differences or issues with team dynamics should they
              arise.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my recent job I was part of a team guiding the development of
              our organisation's Sales CRM system. This project had already been
              going for a while and the pace had been snail like. We were
              essentially told to get it moving and get it done. My role in this
              project has been to provide guidance from a user’s point of view
              and perform user testing. During our frequent meetings, I took a
              passive role, this allowed me to identify areas that were holding
              us up. One key issue was that our development team was reluctant
              to give completion estimates for features, which I presume was
              because they were overloaded with work. This really did not work
              for my manager, who was constantly infuriated by this and let it
              show. Her reactions were not conducive to us finishing the project
              any faster. In this situation, I tried to act as a mediator taking
              a more active role in the meetings, asking for firm plans and
              dates from our development team, and organising the rollout plan
              to ensure visibility over whether these were met or not. I had to
              also play this role in discussions about features where long
              winded debates over minute details were frequent, so I tried to
              summarise conflicting ideas to reach acceptable solutions earlier.
              These approaches did work to get the project moving, just quite
              not at the expected pace. I think if I was in this situation
              again, I would have spent more time preparing for these meetings,
              being more assertive from the start especially during long winded
              discussions. Hopefully by doing that I could have helped to form
              an organised and functional team from the start.
