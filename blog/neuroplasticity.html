						<h5>
							How does an understanding of neuroplasticity benefit
							people
						</h5>
						<p>
							An understanding of neuroplasticity can have two
							benefits for a person. Firstly, understanding
							neuroplasticity allows us to tailor our learning so
							that it is efficient and successful. We can direct
							learning in a way that creates the desired pathways
							in our brain and strengthens them, increasing our
							learning effectiveness. Secondly, having an
							understanding of neuroplasticity allows us to bypass
							the assumptions of fixed ability and intelligence.
							This allows a learner to take back autonomy of their
							learning journey. They can build their own learning
							journeys based on neuroplasticity principles, which
							may take them further than they previously thought
							possible.
						</p>
						<h5>
							Harnessing the principles of neuroplasticity for my
							own benefit
						</h5>
						<p>
							I can use my understanding of neuroplasticity by
							practising tools over and over in different
							situations and in different ways. By keeping in mind
							that I can harness neuroplasticity principles to
							learn anything I can keep myself motivated in
							challenging problems and lessons. The keys for me
							are repetition, variation and determination.
						</p>
						<h5>Increasing your neuroplasticity</h5>
						<p>
							By trying and persevering with new hobbies,
							techniques or practises we can build new pathways in
							our brain. Mindfulness and meditation is a major
							focus for me in this area. I want to develop my
							brain so that I can maximise the benefits of these
							tools. By practising mindfulness everyday, I can
							build and strengthen the pathways in my brain. We
							can increase neuroplasticity by practising, learning
							and persevering through challenging problems and
							concepts. Such as kata and new web development
							projects. You can also increase my neuroplasticity
							through regular exercise and visualisation

						<h5>What is a growth mindset and why is it relevant</h5>
						<p>
							A growth mindset is the concept that intelligence is
							not fixed, and anything can be learned through
							persistence. Dweck also demonstrates how
							understanding this concept itself can be a
							revolutionary factor in motivating children, as it
							increases their belief in themselves, while showing
							them they need to put in hard work to achieve their
							goals and develop themselves. By extrapolating these
							findings outward along with other studies Dweck
							believes a growth mindset can be beneficial to
							anyone. It is relevant to me as I embark on this
							challenging journey, during which I will and have
							already had doubts about my ability for success. By
							knowing that persistence will allow me to succeed
							and grow, I can and will proceed with more
							confidence, and perseverance to push through
							challenging barriers.
						</p>
						<h5>
							What surprised me when learning about the growth
							mindset
						</h5>
						<p>
							I found the motivational aspects of the growth
							mindset interesting, how it can help us to overcome
							doubt and exceed our expectations.
						</p>
						<h5>
							How will you integrate a growth mindset into your
							learning journey?
						</h5>
						<p>
							I want to try to be more process oriented, rather
							than focusing on outcomes. By ensuring that I am
							practising enough and in the right way, I can grow
							my ability as a web developer and person. I need to
							think more about future possibilities rather than
							what is possible now.

							Impact on my learning plan
						</h2>
						<h5>
							Using neuroplasticity and the growth mindset to
							better my learning plan
						</h5>
						<p>
							As I have talked about in my previous answers, the
							things I want to focus on are practising with
							intent, and being conscious of how I am practising.
							This means recording and reviewing how much effort I
							put in. That is not only time spent, but focus
							levels and mental commitment. I should record this
							everyday so that I am accountable for my day's work,
							whether it is great or terrible. To be conscious of
							how I am practising and learning, I should plan each
							day and task out ahead of time, and try to ensure
							that I am trying different approaches etc… I also
							should review and reflect on my practise and
							learning at the end of each task, just summarising
							what I did in a few lines. My commitment to
							mindfulness is a great step in increasing my
							neuroplasticity, and I need to remain committed to
							doing this each day. The key for me is to reflect on
							these concepts and ideas each day, to make sure that
							I utilise the benefits that they provide.
