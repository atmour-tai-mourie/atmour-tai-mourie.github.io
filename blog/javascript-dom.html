							JavaScript and the DOM
						</h2>
						<h5>CSS and HTML</h5>
						<p>
							Building a website is like creating a modern
							animation, with each programming language reflective
							of a different part of the process. The HTML is the
							sketch of the outlines of the image, showing what
							the image is going to be. This stage shows the
							content of the animation, what it is going to show,
							for example if the animation is about a bear and a
							cat, you would see there is a bear and a cat drawn.
							The CSS is the filling of the images with colour and
							detail, the artistic part, making the images look
							beautiful or towards whatever aesthetic is desired.
							Finally JavaScript is the animation stage, where we
							take the static images and make them move. This is
							where all the fun starts to happen and we can really
							see the larger picture evolving.
						</p>
						<h5>Control Flow and Loops</h5>
						<p>
							Control flow is like playing a song, it is simply
							how the music is transferred from the sheet music
							into music over time. Each note is played, along
							each line, left to right. This is how code is read
							and executed, in the simplest form. Each line is
							read, processed and executed.
						</p>
						<p>
							Loops alter this order of procession, just a little
							like a repetitive chorus, they run through a
							specified section over and over, for the desired
							amount of repetitions. The only difference in code,
							is that something slightly different might be
							happening each time, maybe like you are singing the
							chorus of a song and every time through you add in a
							friend's name, until all your friends have had their
							shout out.
						</p>
						<h5>The DOM and Interactiveness</h5>
						<p>
							The document object model (DOM), is a complicated
							representation of a web page document. At its core
							it contains all of the HTML that has been written,
							along with a large amount of other information. The
							DOM has a tree structure, like a family tree. Say
							you have a blue box with a title in it, the title
							will sit under the blue box in the DOM tree, like a
							child would sit under a parent in a family tree. The
							final important thing about the DOM is that it is an
							active model, so although your HTML/other files will
							be reflected in the DOM when the webpage is loaded,
							by interacting with the page we can make changes to
							the DOM and therefore the webpage. We can make
							changes to the DOM simply by pushing a button that
							we have programmed using JavaScript to do something
							such as change the colour of text, or by using the
							dev tools to change the DOM manually (i.e. changing
							the words in a title). The key thing to note is that
							the DOM is a live model of the webpage, that we can
							interact with.
						</p>
						<h5>Accessing Arrays and Objects</h5>
						<p>
							At the most basic level arrays are simply a list,
							like a shopping list. We can add new items to them
							and remove them, but it is just a bunch of things
							separated by commas. Objects are a little more
							abstract and complicated. Structurally objects are
							still just a collection of things like a list, with
							only one difference. Each item on the list has a key
							associated with it, the key is just the name for the
							item. For example, an object might have the item
							“Tai” inside of it, and the key would be “First
							Name”, it is simply a reference for the item in the
							object. The difference in structure between arrays
							and objects, means that we access the data they
							contain in different ways. Since an array is just a
							list of items, we usually access the data by the
							item's position in the list, their index number. So
							for the 1st item, we simply ask for the first item
							(array[0], the first index is 0, so we use 0 instead
							of 1). However, for an object we can use the
							reference (or key) we assign to each item to access
							the item. So to get the first name from the object
							tai, we would specify the object, then the reference
							to the item we need. So tai.firstName would return
							us “Tai”. Simply enough, for arrays we use the
							item's position (or index) in the list, and for
							objects we use the reference (or key) we have
							assigned the item.
						</p>
						<h5>sayHello(to) functions</h5>
						<p>
							Give a Man a Fish, and You Feed Him for a Day. Teach
							a Man To Fish, and You Feed Him for a Lifetime.
						</p>
						<p>
							Enough said. Functions are just blocks of code that
							typically perform some task. The beauty of the
							function is that once we have created a function, we
							can then place that function anywhere to perform
							that task. We can reuse the function over and over
							again, meaning that we only have to write the code
							once, instead of 2, 3, 5, or 10 times. Writing the
							function is like teaching the computer to do
							something, and then all you need to do is tell it
							where to fish.
