						<h2 class="article-link my-4">Learning Plan (Bootcamp)</h2>
						<h5>Why am I here?</h5>
						<p>
							My aim is to move into a developer role to start gaining more experience and practice. In the long term I
							want to give myself more freedom to move around/travel. I would like to move back into financial services,
							but not working for a bank or another large company. I want to help to provide services
							that are not currently accessible to everyday people and that benefit them. This might even come in the
							form of me starting something myself/with others. However I am not locked into this idea, if another
							opportunity that allows me to apply my newly developed skills arises, I might move into another area. I
							just enjoy working on interest technology and concepts with a great moral philosphy behind it. I
							really want to be in a situation that challenges me and is interesting.
						</p>
						<h5>What is going to help and hinder my learning?</h5>
						<p>
							I still think communication, especially in the online format will be the biggest challenge, reminding
							myself to stay engaged with other learners even if I am not directly working with them.
						</p>
						<p>
							My strengths which are problem solving, resourcefulness, persistence and teamwork will still help me
							through the bootcamp. I have been able to utilise these consistently through the foundations material. I
							am struggling with the teamwork aspect over the online format so I will need to make an effort to attend
							any extra events and reach out to people to get to know everyone.
						</p>
						<p>
							During foundations I have also realised that I have a major weakness in the design area. A lack of
							confidence / enthusiasm has meant that I have found myself working more on the functionality of projects
							rather
							than how they visually work and interact. I have a couple of thoughts about this. I could either lean into
							the functionality aspect and specialise more on that side of things, or I could try to work on the visual
							side a little harder. The best option I think is to not care how things look, but still try things
							visually to make them interesting and find a way to get engaged with the visual side of things.
						</p>
						<h5>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be</h5>
						<p>
							It is hard to decide whether it might be the communication side of things or just keeping it together for
							9 weeks and giving every part enough attention. I hope that with daily classes and pair programming,
							meet-ups the social side will develop as I am not a huge IM person.
						</p>
						<p>
							That means I think the biggest challenge will be sustaining effort for the whole course. I don’t usually
							have any issues with focus once I get stuck into a task, it’s that I can draw out the breaks too long, or
							if I get
							distracted it goes for a while. Writing this it is clear that I will just need to focus on staying
							focused, limiting breaks, and putting in extra effort when starting tasks to get in the flow.
						</p>
						<h5>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev
							Academy?</h5>
						<p>
							I would like to work on leadership, reflection and collaboration. Leadership is pretty straightforward, I
							have not seeked out leadership roles in recent years and that needs to change. Reflection is going to
							consist of two focuses, consistency and action. Consistency is just making sure to reflect every day, and
							after each task. Action is making sure that I review my reflections and am acting upon my insights and
							suggestions. Finally collaboration, that is more complex as I enjoy working in groups and seek group
							situations out, I just think I can work on weaving my ideas with others ideas.
						</p>
						<h5>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h5>
						<p>
							My expectations are the same as before. I expect the Bootcamp team to be helpful and available. If I need
							advice on material I should go to others in my cohort first, but if I still need advice I expect the
							Bootcamp team will help. I expect for the assignments and key events to be clearly communicated, and I
							expect the facilitators to help to nurture a valuable learning environment for all students.
						</p>
						<p>
							Additionally, I do ask for understanding from the Bootcamp team when shit happens, or if I get behind.
						</p>
						<h5>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h5>
						<p>
							Again I wrote my earlier commitments with the bootcamp in mind. To manage my workload I need to firstly
							make sure I am aware of my time spent working and time constraints. I need to make sure to use my calendar
							to block out time for certain tasks. When the bootcamp starts to ramp up, I know what I need to do to stay
							in the right headspace to succeed. My only priorities outside of class are spending time with my partner,
							exercising (running during the week, and surfing on the weekend) and occasionally catching up with friends
							or classmates for the odd drink or dinner. I will focus on actively practising pomodoro breaks, they
							provide a healthier working pattern. They also allow me to know when I have been stuck for too long on a
							problem and could do with an extra hand.
						</p>

						<h2 class="article-link my-4">Learning Plan (Foundations)</h2>
						<h5>Why am I here?</h5>
						<p>
							My long term goal is to develop my own ideas or help
							develop other people's ideas I find interesting and
							valuable. I am not particularly driven to climb a
							corporate ladder, I am more concerned about working
							with people that are passionate about what they do
							and why they do it. I want to earn an income by
							doing something that I find both challenging and
							interesting. I want flexibility and freedom. I have
							thought previously that I might enjoy a back-end
							focused role, but I am open to trying things out and
							seeing what I enjoy the most.
						</p>
						<h5>What is going to help and hinder my learning?</h5>
						<p>
							My key strengths are problem solving,
							resourcefulness, persistence and teamwork. The first
							three should help me to find the solution to most
							problems I encounter, however I need to wary about
							myself either struggling on a problem for too long
							before asking for help or creating a hacked together
							solution that works (maybe) but does not follow best
							practice and is confusing to others (possibly also
							to later me). I hope my enjoyment of working in
							teams will help to make anytime spent collaborating
							a valuable learning experience.
						</p>
						<p>
							I need to really push myself to be a self-starter,
							someone that leaps forward at challenges and
							embraces the possibilities of an assignment or idea.
							If I can work on this skill, the learning experience
							at dev academy, and connections made here will be so
							much more valuable. I also need to make sure that I
							am communicating effectively and engaged with the
							cohort, especially during foundations, to allow me
							to reap the benefits that sharing and collaboration
							can have on learning. I would like to work on being
							more open and sharing with my peers regarding my
							work and ideas. In doing this I still need to make
							sure that everyone gets a chance to share,
							encouraging less forthcoming people to share their
							ideas.
						</p>
						<h5>What will I do during this programme?</h5>
						<p>
							To manage my workload I need to firstly make sure I
							am aware of my time spent working and time
							constraints. I need to make sure to use my calendar
							to block out time for certain tasks. When the
							bootcamp starts to ramp up, I know what I need to do
							to stay in the right headspace to succeed. My only
							priorities outside of class are spending time with
							my partner, exercising (running during the week, and
							surfing on the weekend) and occasionally catching up
							with friends or classmates for the odd drink or
							dinner.
						</p>
						<p>
							I will focus on actively practising pomodoro breaks,
							they provide a healthier working pattern. They also
							allow me to know when I have been stuck for too long
							on a problem and could do with an extra hand.
						</p>
						<h5>What do I want from the facilitation team</h5>
						<p>
							I expect the facilitation team to be helpful and
							available. If I need advice on material I should go
							to others in my cohort first, but if I still need
							advice I expect the facilitation team will help. I
							expect for the assignments and key events to be
							clearly communicated, and I expect the facilitators
							to help to nurture a valuable learning environment
							for all students.
						</p>
						<h5>Events to note:</h5>
						<p>
							I do not have any regular commitments such as
							children, but there are two possible times where I
							will need to be elsewhere (hopefully during the
							weekend). The first is that my sister is having a
							baby due early aprile, so I hope to visit the baby
							and her sometime following the birth. Although the
							covid situation may prevent this. I also will be
							moving house at the end of march, hopefully this can
							be arranged to be a weekend, but I may need to take
							half a day off. I am committed to communicating any
							changes and details of these plans as the arise.
