            <h5>Why am I here?</h5>
            <p>
              My long term goal is to develop my own ideas or help develop other
              people's ideas I find interesting and valuable. I am not
              particularly driven to climb a corporate ladder, I am more
              concerned about working with people that are passionate about what
              they do and why they do it. I want to earn an income by doing
              something that I find both challenging and interesting. I want
              flexibility and freedom. I have thought previously that I might
              enjoy a back-end focused role, but I am open to trying things out
              and seeing what I enjoy the most.
            </p>
            <h5>What is going to help and hinder my learning?</h5>
            <p>
              My key strengths are problem solving, resourcefulness, persistence
              and teamwork. The first three should help me to find the solution
              to most problems I encounter, however I need to wary about myself
              either struggling on a problem for too long before asking for help
              or creating a hacked together solution that works (maybe) but does
              not follow best practice and is confusing to others (possibly also
              to later me). I hope my enjoyment of working in teams will help to
              make anytime spent collaborating a valuable learning experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              need to really push myself to be a self-starter, someone that
              leaps forward at challenges and embraces the possibilities of an
              assignment or idea. If I can work on this skill, the learning
              experience at dev academy, and connections made here will be so
              much more valuable. I also need to make sure that I am
              communicating effectively and engaged with the cohort, especially
              during foundations, to allow me to reap the benefits that sharing
              and collaboration can have on learning. I would like to work on
              being more open and sharing with my peers regarding my work and
              ideas. In doing this I still need to make sure that everyone gets
              a chance to share, encouraging less forthcoming people to share
              their ideas.
            </p>
            <h5>What will I do during this programme?</h5>
            <p>
              To manage my workload I need to firstly make sure I am aware of my
              time spent working and time constraints. I need to make sure to
              use my calendar to block out time for certain tasks. When the
              bootcamp starts to ramp up, I know what I need to do to stay in
              the right headspace to succeed. My only priorities outside of
              class are spending time with my partner, exercising (running
              during the week, and surfing on the weekend) and occasionally
              catching up with friends or classmates for the odd drink or
              dinner.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will focus on actively practising pomodoro breaks, they provide
              a healthier working pattern. They also allow me to know when I
              have been stuck for too long on a problem and could do with an
              extra hand.
            </p>
            <h5>What do I want from the facilitation team</h5>
            <p>
              I expect the facilitation team to be helpful and available. If I
              need advice on material I should go to others in my cohort first,
              but if I still need advice I expect the facilitation team will
              help. I expect for the assignments and key events to be clearly
              communicated, and I expect the facilitators to help to nurture a
              valuable learning environment for all students.
            </p>
            <h5>Events to note:</h5>
            <p>
              I do not have any regular commitments such as children, but there
              are two possible times where I will need to be elsewhere
              (hopefully during the weekend). The first is that my sister is
              having a baby due early aprile, so I hope to visit the baby and
              her sometime following the birth. Although the covid situation may
              prevent this. I also will be moving house at the end of march,
              hopefully this can be arranged to be a weekend, but I may need to
              take half a day off. I am committed to communicating any changes
              and details of these plans as the arise.
