                        <h5>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the
                            core learning?</h5>
                        <p>
                            I have learned that I have a strongly ingrained fixed mindset, especially the mindset of
                            only being able to develop existing strengths, and not being able to be successful in areas
                            outside of these strengths. I also learnt that vulnerability can be extremely powerful, and
                            that I have a tendency to avoid vulnerability, hiding it not only from others but myself.
                            Finally I learnt about how easy it is for me to start doing something, but applying new
                            learnings and practices consistently is something I struggle with. This was evident in my
                            time planning and reflection, where I managed to keep it up well for a couple of weeks, but
                            then it all became more sporadic and unorganised.
                        </p>
                        <h5>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Values, empathy and self awareness not only in learning and programming, but in everything
                            you do can be a powerful tool for direction and guidance. They can allow you to identify
                            what really matters, and can act as a solid point to steer towards. Empathy while working
                            for others creates much more rewarding experience, allowing for connections to flourish, and
                            awesome ideas to come to fruition. Empathy towards yourself and self awareness can help you
                            to blossom as an individual, self kindness can make an awful day into a positive learning
                            experience.
                        </p>
                        <h5>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Without a doubt I have been surprised the most by the impact of practising meditation. As my
                            meditation sessions progress I can feel my instinctive responses and emotions towards the
                            world around me slip away as I am engulfed in clarity. In these moments I can feel what
                            truly matters to me, I can easily direct my mind and soul to focus on what is important.
                            This helps me to live up to my morals and values, as the noise of my mind and body can
                            distort how I act, and pull me away from these. When I am finished, the calm relaxed state I
                            am in helps me to get everything I need to get done, done.
                        </p>
                        <h5>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            The most challenging aspect of the core learning is trying to apply it all at once, for me
                            each area requires persistence and consistency. Even though I can be very persistent for a
                            while or even a couple of weeks, I have not been persistent over long periods in the past,
                            and consistency has historically not been a word in my vocabulary. My time spent
                            consistently meditating and running in the past few months has shown me the value that can
                            be gained from applying yourself consistently at the same skill. So now the goal for me is
                            to figure out what other practices are important or easy for me to apply, and make sure I do
                            them.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
                            learning in a web development bootcamp course?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            The reason is in the name, Core, this learning helps to build the foundation for us as
                            learners to become successful developers. The core learning content is like an amplifier to
                            maximise the value of time spent learning code and coding concepts. The core content also
                            amplifies our abilities once we are in the workforce, helping us to be proficient,
                            continuously learn and keep ourselves and peers sane while we learn and work. It also helps
                            to reinforce that knowing how to write code and build things isn't the sole measure for
                            success, wellbeing, ability to learn, ability to collaborate, self value etc… are all
                            crucial to becoming a great coder, colleague, friend.
                        </p>
                        <h5>
                            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
                            have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.

                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            As is emphasised in my answers above the core content is just as valuable as the programming
                            content. In my opinion both the tech and core content are complimentary. There is great
                            value in the direction and guidance from learning to program from experts. There is just as
                            much value, maybe more in learning the core skills from educators with experience and
                            expertise in the field. To be told “hey this works for us, you should try this” is a lot
                            easier than scouring the internet through self help articles. Then to pair both the core
                            content with the tech content, maximises the value that we gain from the tech component. I
                            don’t really see them as separate, they are just each half of the larger puzzle we are
                            trying to solve.
