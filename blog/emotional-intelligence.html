            <h5>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h5>
            <p>
              Emotional Intelligence is the intersection between the cognitive
              and emotional systems of a person. Being emotionally intelligent
              is being aware and proactive regarding the emotions of yourself
              and others, along with strong relationship managements skills.
              Developed in 1985 by Wayne Payne in his doctorial thesis "A Study
              of Emotion: Developing Emotional Intelligence", then popularised
              by Daniel Goleman 1985, the idea has been around for a little
              while now. Goleman describes five components of emotional
              intelligence, something I find helpful to keep in mind, knowing
              one's emotions, managing emotions, motivating oneself, recognize
              emotions of others, and handling relationships.

            <h5>How is it different to IQ?</h5>
            <p>
              IQ is a measure of ability in intellectual pursuits such as
              comprehension and application of skillsets alongside ability to
              learn, measured by a set of standardised assessments. While IQ is
              largely associated with general academic ability, emotional
              intelligence revolves around awareness of ones self and others.
              Although a high IQ can be factor in success, and even though there
              are difficulties in attributing high performance to IQ or
              emotional intelligence (or even defining high performance or
              success in my opinion), there are some clear benefits to emotional
              intelligence that IQ cannot provide. So even if someone possesses
              a high IQ, emotional intelligence is still important to improving
              many factors of a persons work or personal life.
            </p>
            <h5>Why is emotional intelligence important?</h5>
            <p>
              Emotional Intelligence is important for the benefits it can
              provide relating to work performance, life satisfaction, personal
              relationships and other areas. By improving how we act, react and
              interact with those around us, we can improve in all the
              aforementioned areas.
