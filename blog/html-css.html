              What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids
              as tags for HTML elements? Before researching the use of classes
              and IDs, I didn’t see any reason for using IDs at all. You can
              just use a class, right? To pull apart this question, I needed to
              find out what makes IDs different from classes, what actually are
              best practices, and how are the best practices justified.
            </p>
            <h5>A (not so) brief primer on HTML, elements and CSS.</h5>
            <p>
              HTML is a programming language used to build websites. It is the
              core building tool, used to specify the content of the web page,
              images and text and all that jazz. HTML also is used to build the
              basic structure of the page, laying out where the text, content,
              etc… is placed on the page and how combinations of text and images
              are grouped together.
            </p>
            <p>
              Elements are the building blocks of HTML, they are used to specify
              what the content being added is.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, using the element <img /> specifies that the element
              is an image,
            </p>
            <p>&lt;ol&gt; is an ordered list such as</p>
            <ol>
              <li>foo</li>
              <li>bar</li>
              <li>baz</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Along with defining the content, elements are used when laying out
              the structure of a webpage. Content such as images and text, can
              be placed inside of another element such as a &lt;div&gt;, which
              is like a box containing the content.
            </p>
            <p class="row align-items-center">
              <code class="mr-5">
                &lt;div&gt; <br />
                &lt;img src="http://placekitten.com/100/100"&gt; <br />
                &lt;p&gt;This is kitten&lt;/p&gt; <br />
                &lt;/div&gt;
              </code>
              <img
                src="../images/div-box-example.png"
                alt="Example showing how a div can contain image and text elements"
                class="ml-5 my-3"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              The example above shows an image (&lt;img&gt;) and text
              (&lt;p&gt;) wrapped in a div (&lt;div&gt;). In the output next to
              it you can see that the image and text with a red outline are
              inside of the div which has a black outline. That is the
              fundamentals on how elements are used in HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
              One final note about elements. In the example above you may notice
              that the image (&lt;img&gt;) element has src=”http://place…”
              inside of this. This is an attribute, more specifically the source
              attribute for the image, telling the webpage where to find the
              image it needs to use. There are other types of attributes for
              elements as well, two of which are the focus of this post. They
              are ID and the Class element, these will be explained shortly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now let’s talk about CSS. Before we can get into the IDs and
              classes, we need to understand what CSS does. CSS gives a page
              it’s visual pzazz, it’s funk, it is used to define what colours
              are used, what size elements are, where they are on the page and
              so much more. However, to give an element a colour or any other
              styling with CSS, we need to specify which element we want to
              apply our specific CSS code to. For example, to make my text in
              the example above pink, I can write the following:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code> #image-text { color: pink; } </code>
            </p>
            <p>
              This will pick up the object (my text) with the ID = “image-text”,
              and make it all pretty in pink.
            </p>
            <h5>IDs</h5>
            <p>
              IDs are an attribute we can assign to an element, that is a unique
              identifier. Like your driver’s licence number or studylink client
              ID, this should be unique to you or in this case the element. We
              can assign an id by simply including id=”id-name” in an element,
              e.g. &lt;id=”image-text”&gt;. Because the ID is unique, when using
              the ID to select an element in CSS to style we can be sure that it
              will only style the one element with that ID.
            </p>
            <p><code> #image-text { color: pink; } </code></p>

              >
              - Ray Enoch (cssdeck.com/blog/when-to-use-css-ids-and-classes)
            </p>
            <h5>Classes</h5>
            <p>
              Classes are an attribute that is used to define a group of
              elements. Unlike IDs, we can put the same class on multiple
              different elements. We in turn can make an element belong to
              multiple classes. This allows us to set a rule in CSS, and apply
              it to multiple elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I had five different images, and I wanted to put a blue border
              around each of them, I could give them all the same class. By
              adding the attribute class=”image-border” to each image, we could
              then specify the following in CSS
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>
                .image-border { <br />
                border-style: solid; <br />
                border-color: blue;<br />
                }
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Any element with the class=”image-border” would now have a blue
              border, so I could add this class attribute to all of my images
              that I want to have the border.
            </p>
            <h5>Best practice for using IDs and classes</h5>
            <p>
              The consensus from a variety of sources, is that it is best
              practice to use IDs to apply css styling to elements that are
              unique from all other elements. Such as if all you text on the
              page is black but one text element needs to be blue. In that case
              you would assign the blue text element an ID and use this in CSS
              to apply the blue colour. Classes are to be used when the styling
              is applied to more than one specific object or if the styling is
              likely to be used again in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              That is as expected really, and although it is best practice I was
              not convinced on why I have to use IDs. I have never found any
              situation where I couldn’t just use a class even if it was a
              unique element, and I have found that to look cleaner and made it
              easier to review my code and make changes. In my research I found
              many opinions along the same lines, why use IDs? Why? I almost
              stopped there, unchanged in my opinion, unwilling to concede.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately as per usual one person came in with a complex, yet
              extremely well written and understandable explanation to give this
              stubborn mule a shove in the right direction. I will attempt to
              explain, while leaving the links below for you to read if you
              leave this post without a clue about what I am trying to say.
            </p>
            <h5>Specificity</h5>
            <p>
              The answer to why we (possibly) need to use IDs alongside classes
              is specificity. This essentially is how CSS determines how to
              apply rules, specifically in the case when two conflicting styles
              apply to the same element. Say I have a text element with
              class=”text-primary”, and in my CSS code I have stated the
              following:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>
                .text-primary { <br />
                color: red; <br />
                }
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>
                .text-primary { <br />
                color: blue; <br />
                }
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>
              What colour would my text be? In this case it would be blue. The
              basic rule of specificity is that if the selector (essentially
              what is used to select the element i.e class, ID etc…) is the
              same, then the latest rule (furthest down the page) is used. So in
              this case the blue colour rule is after the red colour rule so the
              colour of the text will be blue. Hopefully simple enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now getting to IDs and classes, almost 100% of the time if an
              element has both a class and an ID, and these are both used to
              apply a style to elements in CSS, the style using the ID as the
              selector will be used, regardless of order on the page. Take a
              look at my previous example where the text element now has the
              id=”image1-text”, alongside the class=”text-primary”.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>
                #image1-text { <br />
                color: red; <br />
                }
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>
                .text-primary { <br />
                color: blue; <br />
                }
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>
              My text will now be red. As the ID selector “image1-text” is used
              over the class selector.
            </p>
            <p>
              What does this mean for how we use IDs and classes? By using an ID
              for a unique element we can ensure that styling applied to this ID
              will be used on this element. Since multiple classes can be
              assigned to an element we can ensure that we will not have the
              problem of a class giving the element one style, then overriding
              our intended styling in another class CSS rule.
            </p>
            <p id="last-blog-paragraph">
              That is the key reason that I could identify why, in theory we
              should use IDs alongside classes. A developer could argue that
              with tidy organised code, using just classes and avoiding
              conflicting style declarations is just as easy and functional as
              using IDs. Although that developer is inexperienced, should
              probably just follow what is deemed to be best practice. I think I
              will need to start using IDs, maybe.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> When using javascript and possibly other
              tools, IDs can be important especially for selecting elements
              using the getElementById() selector to use in your js script. The
              above discussion simply refers to the use of IDs as a CSS
              selector.
